**NOTICE:** This repo is being repurposed and will host the Kubernetes.io CNCF Chinese Translation Workforce project. Consequently, the contents of [k8smeetup/k8smeetup.github.io](https://github.com/k8smeetup/k8smeetup.github.io) will be moved here, and the previous contents of the `master` branch will be located in the [kubernetes-docs-cn-master-archive.zip](/kubernetes-docs-cn-master-archive.zip) file.

The `release-1.1-cn` branch is still currently; however, it will be deprecated once the open issue and pull request authors have been properly notified and those issues/PRs have been closed.


The workflow for the CNCF Chinese Translation Workforce is documented here:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xz7BhW8Qkh6reYU7S7RDzSov5e101Vz_fHjq-fEX-W4/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xz7BhW8Qkh6reYU7S7RDzSov5e101Vz_fHjq-fEX-W4/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs)

Changes are coordinated via the WeChat Group (for instant communication) and a worksheet, which includes the article index, work assignment, internal reviewer assignees and status, is tracking the progress:
